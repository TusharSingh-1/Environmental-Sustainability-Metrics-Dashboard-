# Environmental-Sustainability-Metrics-Dashboard-
This project aims to create a unified, interactive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Dashboard to monitor a company’s environmental performance and climate risks.
Using IBM Cognos Analytics, the dashboard transforms global climate data (update_temperature.csv) into actionable insights that help organizations reduce emissions, improve renewable energy usage, and manage sustainability initiatives more effectively.
